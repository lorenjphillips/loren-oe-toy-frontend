# OpenEvidence Ad Platform Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing approach for the OpenEvidence pharmaceutical ad platform. It provides guidance for different testing levels to ensure the platform functions correctly, performs well, and provides a good user experience.

## Overall Testing Strategy

Our testing strategy follows a comprehensive approach with multiple testing layers:

1. **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components and functions in isolation
2. **Integration Testing**: Testing interactions between components and services
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Testing complete user flows and scenarios
4. **User Experience Testing**: Evaluating the platform from a user's perspective
5. **Performance Testing**: Ensuring the platform performs well under various conditions

## Unit Testing Approach

### Frontend Components

Unit tests for React components will focus on:

- **Rendering**: Components render correctly with different props
- **User Interactions**: Components respond appropriately to user actions
- **State Management**: Component state updates correctly
- **Error Handling**: Components handle errors gracefully

#### Implementation Plan:

1. Use Jest and React Testing Library for component testing
2. Create test files with the naming convention `[ComponentName].test.tsx`
3. Test both the default state and edge cases
4. Mock external dependencies using Jest mock functions

### Example Component Test:

```typescript
// AdDisplay.test.tsx
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import { AdDisplay } from '@/components/AdDisplay';

describe('AdDisplay', () => {
  it('renders ad content correctly', () => {
    const mockAd = {
      id: '123',
      title: 'Test Ad',
      content: 'This is a test ad',
      company: 'Pharma Co'
    };
    
    render(<AdDisplay ad={mockAd} />);
    
    expect(screen.getByText('Test Ad')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText('This is a test ad')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText('Pharma Co')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
  
  it('tracks impressions when displayed', () => {
    const mockTrackImpression = jest.fn();
    const mockAd = { id: '123', title: 'Test Ad' };
    
    render(<AdDisplay 
      ad={mockAd} 
      trackImpression={mockTrackImpression} 
    />);
    
    expect(mockTrackImpression).toHaveBeenCalledWith('123');
  });
});
```

### Service Units

Unit tests for services will focus on:

- **Function Behavior**: Services produce expected outputs for given inputs
- **Error Handling**: Services handle unexpected inputs or API failures
- **Edge Cases**: Services handle boundary conditions

## Integration Testing Plan

Integration tests will verify that different parts of the system work together correctly:

### API Integration Tests

1. Test API routes with mock requests
2. Verify correct handling of different request parameters
3. Test error handling and response formats

### Service Integration Tests

1. Test interactions between services (e.g., ClassifierService and AdService)
2. Verify data flows correctly through the system
3. Test with realistic data scenarios

### Component Integration Tests

1. Test interactions between related components
2. Verify state management across component hierarchies
3. Test data flow from API to UI components

## End-to-End Testing

End-to-end tests will validate complete user flows:

1. **Question Submission Flow**: From question entry to ad display to answer presentation
2. **Ad Interaction Flow**: From ad display to click handling to destination
3. **Admin Flow**: Managing ads, viewing analytics, and adjusting settings

### Implementation Plan:

1. Use Cypress for end-to-end testing
2. Create test scenarios that mimic real user behavior
3. Test on multiple browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility
4. Include both happy path and error path testing

## User Experience Testing Guidelines

UX testing will focus on qualitative aspects of the platform:

### Usability Testing

1. Recruit healthcare professionals for testing sessions
2. Create task scenarios that reflect real-world usage
3. Observe and record user interactions and feedback
4. Measure task completion rates and time-on-task

### A/B Testing

1. Identify key UI elements or flows to optimize
2. Create variants with different designs or behaviors
3. Measure performance metrics for each variant
4. Implement the best-performing variant

### Accessibility Testing

1. Test with screen readers and other assistive technologies
2. Verify compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards
3. Test keyboard navigation throughout the application
4. Ensure appropriate color contrast and text sizing

## Performance Testing Considerations

Performance testing will ensure the platform performs well under various conditions:

### Load Testing

1. Simulate multiple concurrent users accessing the platform
2. Measure response times under different load levels
3. Identify performance bottlenecks
4. Establish performance baselines

### API Performance

1. Measure response times for critical API endpoints
2. Test with varying payload sizes
3. Verify caching mechanisms work effectively
4. Monitor external API dependencies (e.g., OpenAI)

### Client-Side Performance

1. Measure page load times and time-to-interactive
2. Profile JavaScript execution and memory usage
3. Optimize asset loading and rendering
4. Test on various devices to ensure responsive performance

## Test Automation Strategy

1. Implement CI/CD pipeline integration for automated testing
2. Run unit and integration tests on every pull request
3. Run end-to-end tests on staging environment before production deployment
4. Set up performance monitoring for continuous performance testing

## Test Environment Requirements

1. Development environment for unit and integration testing
2. Staging environment that mirrors production
3. Test data sets that represent realistic usage scenarios
4. Mock services for external dependencies

## Test Reporting and Metrics

1. Track test coverage for code quality assessment
2. Monitor test pass/fail rates to identify problematic areas
3. Track performance metrics over time to identify regressions
4. Generate test reports for stakeholder communication

## Test Maintenance

1. Review and update tests as features evolve
2. Refactor tests to reduce duplication and improve maintainability
3. Periodically review and update test data
4. Maintain documentation of testing procedures and best practices

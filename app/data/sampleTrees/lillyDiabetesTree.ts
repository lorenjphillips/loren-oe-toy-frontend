  explanation: 'The addition of a GLP-1 receptor agonist with appropriate adjustment of sulfonylurea dosing represents guideline-concordant, evidence-based care for this patient. The significant improvement in glycemic control, weight reduction, and absence of hypoglycemia demonstrates successful treatment intensification. Studies such as the AWARD series of clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of dulaglutide in lowering HbA1c when added to existing oral antihyperglycemic medications.',

  patientStatus: 'unchanged',
  explanation: 'The chosen treatment approach provided some benefit but failed to achieve optimal glycemic control. Suboptimal responses to GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy may result from inadequate dosing, poor adherence due to side effects, or the need for additional antihyperglycemic agents. The moderate improvement in HbA1c suggests some efficacy but indicates the need for treatment adjustment.',
  followUp: 'Consider uptitration of dulaglutide to 1.5mg weekly if tolerated. Evaluate adherence to medication and lifestyle modifications. Add an SGLT-2 inhibitor if no contraindications exist.

  explanation: 'Failure to appropriately adjust sulfonylurea dosing when adding a GLP-1 receptor agonist significantly increases hypoglycemia risk. This adverse outcome demonstrates the importance of medication adjustment during treatment intensification. The resulting fear of hypoglycemia has led to nonadherence and worsened glycemic control, illustrating how safety concerns can undermine therapeutic efficacy.',
